# text-to-speech-app
This is a spinoff from Brad Traversy's app I followed along with in
a youtube video.  I'm getting a grasp on the javascript, and will
know a lot more as I progress throug Lambda School.

The styling still needs to be worked on but all done by me with LESS.

Here's Brad's repo: https://github.com/bradtraversy/type-n-speak
